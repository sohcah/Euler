0001 Only brute force
0002 Only brute force
0003 Sieves as it goes starting with 2 and odds (3+) up to sqrt of target numbers
0004 Exhaustive!
0005 Algorithm avoiding need for prime factorisation!
0006 Formulaic approach to triangle numbers and sums of squares! (-:
0007 Sieve method, but crude approach to how big initial set (2 and 3+ odds) should be - might fail for sufficiently large n
0008 test would fail with start like 8709999 I think! (early zero with maxprod before second zero)
0009 Only finds first one (if more than one answer); not sure about max possible b.
0010 Fairly decent, but would fail if result became too big.
0011



To do:
0001v2 clever maths version using lcm's (and lcm's of lcm's ...!) and triangle numbers!
0002v2 based on Odd Even, Even Odd, Odd Odd or Even Even start, approach based only on calculating evens for any integer start pair?
0003v2 Only when I've looked into most effective methods for prime set generation!
0004v2 Work out from largest possible product down so it can stop immediately on success?
0007v2 number of primes less than n (over-)estimating function?
0008v2 check for (and deal with) early zero issue!
0009v2 In cases where there is more than one possible abc combination find them all?
0010v2 maybe bigint if needed?
